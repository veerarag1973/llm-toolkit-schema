"""Typed exception hierarchy for llm-schema.

All exceptions raised by llm-schema inherit from :class:`LLMSchemaError` so
callers can catch the whole family with a single ``except LLMSchemaError``.

Design rules
------------
* Exceptions carry enough context to be actionable — field name, received value,
  and an explanation of what was expected.
* HMAC keys and PII-tagged content are **never** embedded in exception messages
  or ``__cause__`` chains.
* No bare ``raise`` — every raise site uses a typed subclass.
